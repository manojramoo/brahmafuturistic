        <h1>Ancient Technology, Applied Insights: The Pathway of Astrology</h1>
        <p>
          Astrology is the methodology for understanding our past, present, and future events. It is a Vedic science, rooted in
          the ancient Gurukul system of education, where knowledge was imparted directly by enlightened masters. In those times,
          sages predicted the movements of the Grahas (planets) through extraordinary insight, sometimes using the technique of
          Anima — leaving their physical body to traverse the universe in its smallest form. Through these journeys, they
          observed how planetary movements influence life on Earth and impact human destiny.
        </p>
        <p>
          The primary Grahas considered in Vedic astrology are Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn, along with
          the shadow grahas Rahu and Ketu. While the universe contains countless celestial bodies, these Grahas have the most
          significant effect on human life.
        </p>
        <p>
          To understand astrology in a modern context, consider this analogy: when a person wants to reach a destination,
          traveling by themselves, they may encounter unforeseen obstacles, delays, or detours that extend their journey beyond
          expectations. Today, a tool like Google Maps can provide the best route, approximate time of arrival, and warnings of
          potential disruptions, helping travelers reach their destination efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, ancient technology applied through astrology provides guidance for life. It reveals challenges beforehand,
          highlights the best path to take, and prepares the seeker to navigate obstacles effectively. By understanding the
          patterns of the Grahas, individuals can make informed decisions, minimize difficulties, and reach their life goals in a
          smoother and often more timely manner than they might have otherwise expected.
