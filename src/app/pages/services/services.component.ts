        <h1>Services</h1>
        <p>
          Approaching an astrologer requires the blessings of God and the readiness of one’s karma. While anyone may come seeking
          guidance, true benefit arises only when the seeker believes in and follows the guidance provided meticulously by
          Dr. YesJ. If you are reading this, consider yourself blessed for taking the first step toward spiritual insight and
          clarity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. YesJ’s services provide guidance, methodology, and the foundational process to navigate life’s challenges. However,
          it is ultimately the individual who must decide, act, and follow through to implement these insights and attain the
          desired outcomes.
